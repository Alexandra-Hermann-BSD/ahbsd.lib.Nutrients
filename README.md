# ahbsd.lib.Nutrients
A library project for nutrients in Core3.1

## The reason for YANL (Yet Another Nutrition Library
Each of the nutrition APPs that I used had pro's and contra's. Most I want is

1. As much of nutrients, my iPhone can save in HealthKit
2. A versioning of Foods. Because the amount of ingredients change and changing 
the Amount of ingredients and/or the amount of nutrients doesn't mean, that another 
charge several weeks before have the same nutrient amounts listed on the product.
So it doesn't make sense always to change the amounts, if there may be already another 
version.

Sometimes I ask myself if the dvelopers, that develop such apps don't need a version
control system like Git etc. If they do, they should also think of things that can
change in the data of their product.

So this is one of the main reasons, why I started this open source library.
